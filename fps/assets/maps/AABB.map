# Example of a map file. Commetns start with #, the rest of the line is ignored.
# sections are indicated by :/ . It will either recognize a basic type, or.. do something
# which is not implemented yet.
# currently supported predefined tags are AABB.
# the start of an object is signifed by { and ended by }.
# members of tagged objects are expected to be in _FIXED_ order, with no empty lines in between.
# furthermore, both opening and closing braces should be on separate lines,
# and now white space is expected before opening and closing brace.
# whitespace at the start of tags is consumed.
